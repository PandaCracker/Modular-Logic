# Modular-Logic
A low-level digital logic simulator

You place and connect logic gates, combine them into new circuits, and create as simple or complex a system as you'd like

## Current state of the project
Basic logic gates are fully operational, technically allowing any computational task to be performed.
Functionality of Compound gates is in progress, allowing for more compact and more easily understandable networks.
Persistence of previously created Compound gates is planned after full functionality, for faster construction over multiple sessions
