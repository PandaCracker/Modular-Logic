# Modular-Logic
Computer simulation which can use arbitrary simulations to replace standard logic gates

Main idea is to create a basic computer/calculator made of logic gate components, then have different systems
which can simulate a computer replace the standard logic gates, e.g. a Minecraft redstone circuit replacing an XOR,
or a Wireworld simulation replacing an AND.
